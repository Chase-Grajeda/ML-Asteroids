CURRENT ISSUES: 
- Make class / list for all text bodies (it's just more efficient) 


- Ship asset is not thick enough/loss of quality on rotation

TODO: 
- Make assets for smaller asteroids (scaling won't work) 
- Pause/play? 
- Game over (remove ship)? 
- Begin research on machine learning




NOTES: 
- Asteroid spawner is not 100% random 
    - Asteroids are more likely to spawn on the sides rather than top or bottom 
    - Left and right have uniform probability 
    - Top and bottom have uniform probability 

- POINTS: 
    - 20  Large 
    - 50  Medium 
    - 100 Small
