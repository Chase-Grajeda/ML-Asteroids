CURRENT ISSUES: 
- Can't get propre trajectory 
    - Confirmed, rect.x and rect.y only take whole numbers 
    - How else can I move the sprite without using whole numbers? 
    - Implement in asteroid move() function 
- Ship asset is not thick enough/loss of quality on rotation

TODO: 
- Create Spawn system for asteroids 
    - Spawn asteroids in spawn box 
    - Find a way to safely remove asteroids from game 
    - Spawn asteroids with a trajectors ~towards~ center 
        - Should have some degrees of freedom 


- Need to set up assets for bullets/lazers 




For spawning asteroid: 
- Generate random spawn coordinates (x,y)
- Create new asteroid object, centered on (x,y) 
- Add to list of asteroids 


NOTES: 
- Asteroid spawner is not 100% random 
    - Asteroids are more likely to spawn on the sides rather than top or bottom 
    - Left and right have uniform probability 
    - Top and bottom have uniform probability
