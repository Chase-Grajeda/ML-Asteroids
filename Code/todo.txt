    - Add environment vision 
    - Add ship vision ("radar") 

- Research how to machine learn 
- Game Over handling for solo play

    - Asteroids are more likely to spawn on the sides rather than top or bottom 
    - Left and right have uniform probability 
    - Top and bottom have uniform probability
