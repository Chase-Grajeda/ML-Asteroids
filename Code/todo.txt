TODO: 
- Implement Training environment 
    - Bullet spawns for populations 
    - Score/fitness for populations 
    - Collisions for populations 
    - Kill population at game over 
    - Start new generation at game over 
    - Generation tracking 

- Implement vision for ships 

- Research how to machine learn 
- Game Over handling for solo play 



NOTES: 
- Asteroid spawner is not 100% random 
    - Asteroids are more likely to spawn on the sides rather than top or bottom 
    - Left and right have uniform probability 
    - Top and bottom have uniform probability
