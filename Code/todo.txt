CURRENT ISSUES: 
- Make class / list for all text bodies (it's just more efficient) 
- Decided to not use speed in asteroid distance calculation 
- Initial asteroid distance is set to 500 if there are no asteroids in sight 

TODO: 
- Implement weight data storage 
    - Store training data (so it can be resumed) 
    - Store data from each generation and the generation number 

- Game Over handling for solo play 



NOTES: 
- Asteroid spawner is not 100% random 
    - Asteroids are more likely to spawn on the sides rather than top or bottom 
    - Left and right have uniform probability 
    - Top and bottom have uniform probability
