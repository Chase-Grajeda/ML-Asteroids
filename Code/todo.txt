CURRENT ISSUES: 
- Make class / list for all text bodies (it's just more efficient) 


- Ship asset is not thick enough/loss of quality on rotation

TODO: 
- Implement Training environment 
    - Generate mulitple populations (STRESS TEST!!!!) 
        - Each population will have its own set of asteroids and player 
        - None of the populations will be able to interact with each other 

- Research how to machine learn 
- Game Over handling for solo play 



NOTES: 
- Asteroid spawner is not 100% random 
    - Asteroids are more likely to spawn on the sides rather than top or bottom 
    - Left and right have uniform probability 
    - Top and bottom have uniform probability 

- POINTS: 
    - 20  Large 
    - 50  Medium 
    - 100 Small
