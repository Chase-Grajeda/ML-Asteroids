CURRENT ISSUES: 
- Ship asset is not thick enough/loss of quality on rotation

TODO: 
- Create Spawn system for asteroids 
    - Give trajectories a degree of freedom 

- Need to set up assets for bullets/lazers 





NOTES: 
- Asteroid spawner is not 100% random 
    - Asteroids are more likely to spawn on the sides rather than top or bottom 
    - Left and right have uniform probability 
    - Top and bottom have uniform probability
